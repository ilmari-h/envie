Envie is easy to integrate with any production pipeline or developer environment, working as a dropin replacement for .env files and tools like dotenv.

### üì¶ Installation

Envie is available as a CLI tool on npm.

To install it globally on your machine, run:

```bash
npm install -g @envie/cli
```

Now you are ready to use Envie!
