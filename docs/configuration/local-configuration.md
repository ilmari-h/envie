Envie configuration can, for the most part, be managed via the CLI. See `envie config --help`.

Local configuration is stored in a config.json file which is found under the standard configuration directory of your operating system:
  - Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`*/envie*
  - macOS: *~/Library/Application Support/envie*

You can override this with the environment variable `ENVIE_CONFIG_DIRECTORY`.
